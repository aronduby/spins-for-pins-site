# It's Submitted!

The browser extension has now been submitted as an official [Firefox Add-On][firefox-add-ons], and once this silly little site is running I'll be able to finish getting it submitted to the [Chrome Web Store][chrome-web-store] (they require links to some things FireFox just lets you type in). Those are the official links, so once all the submission and review and whatnot is done they'll just work.

In the meantime, if you ask nicely I might give you a version to side load.
